### Process ###

* Reviewers are listed in the CODEOWNERS file
* Code format guidelines

AMD SMI uses the clang-format tool for formatting code in source files.
The formatting style is captured in .clang-format which is located at
the root of AMD SMI. These are different options to follow:

   1. Using pre-commit and docker - `pre-commit run`
   1. Using only clang-format - `clang-format -i \<path-to-the-source-file\>`
