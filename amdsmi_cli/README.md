# AMD SMI CLI tool

A command line tool for manipulating and monitoring the `amdgpu` kernel;
`amd-smi` is intended to replace and deprecate the existing
[`rocm-smi`](https://github.com/rocm/rocm_smi_lib) CLI tool.

When using the CLI tool, you should have at least one AMD GPU and the driver
installed.

>[!NOTE]
>The AMD SMI CLI tool is provided as an example code to aid the development of
>telemetry tools. The Python or C++ library is recommended as a robust data
>source.
