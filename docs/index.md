# AMD SMI documentation

The AMD System Management Interface (AMD SMI) library offers a unified tool for
managing and monitoring GPUs, particularly in high-performance computing
environments. It provides a user-space interface that allows applications to
control GPU operations, monitor performance, and retrieve information about the
system's drivers and GPUs.

Find the source code at <https://github.com/ROCm/amdsmi>.

```{note}
AMD SMI is the successor to <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib>.
